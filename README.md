# 💫 About Me ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ftth05&color=green)

## Hi there, my name is Fettah Kiran 👋

I am currently a Ph.D. student conducting research in the Affective & Data Computing [ACDC](https://cpl.uh.edu/index.php/) lab at the University of Houston under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Ioannis Pavlidis.

My Ph.D. research work is on Affective Computing which is a captivating field that explores the interaction between humans and computers, particularly focusing on understanding and responding to human emotions.
  
💡 **Ongoing Project: Affective Computing in Math Learning**

In this NSF-funded project, we employ Affective Computing techniques to delve into the emotional responses of students facing challenges in learning math. A unique aspect of our approach is the integration of thermal imaging to monitor stress levels during math exams.

📚 **Expertise:**
- Affective Computing
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision

🤝 **Open for Collaboration:**
We welcome collaboration and discussion on Affective Computing, machine learning, and related fields. 

If you have insights or questions, let's connect!
